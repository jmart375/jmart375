## Packet Sniffers
A packet sniffer, also called a packet analyzer, protocol analyzer or network analyzer, is      used to intercept, log, and analyze network traffic and data. These are tools designed to capture and analyze packets transmitted over a network. They operate by intercepting and logging network traffic, allowing users to examine the contents of packets for various purposes.
  - [Wireshark](https://github.com/jmart375/Wireshark/tree/main) facilitates in-depth network traffic inspection, protocol analysis, and threat detection, enabling organizations to enhance their cybersecurity posture and respond effectively to potential security incidents.

## Penetration Testing
Also known as "pen test", simulates an attack on a computer system in order to evaluate the 
security of that system.
- [Kali Linux](https://github.com/jmart375/VirtualBox-Virtual-Machine-Setup-Project) VirtualBox Machine Set Up
- [Reconnaissance](https://github.com/jmart375/Reconnaissance/) involves actively or passively collecting information about a target's systems, networks, and online presence, serving as the initial phase in a cyber attack to identify vulnerabilities and plan subsequent actions.
- [Enumeration, Scanning, Exploit](https://github.com/jmart375/Enumeration-Scanning-Exploit/tree/main) refers to the systematic process of discovering and identifying target system details, assessing vulnerabilities, and leveraging identified weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or control.
  
## PowerShell 
PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework. PowerShell runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

  - [Active Directory](https://github.com/jmart375/Active-directory) Bulk User Creation. Streamlines and automates the process of user provisioning within an organization's directory services.
  - [JWipe](https://github.com/jmart375/Jwipe.PoweShell) (Disk Wiping Utility) ensures the permanent and irretrievable removal of sensitive information from storage devices, meeting stringent data privacy and compliance requirements for organizations and individuals seeking thorough disk wiping capabilities.
  - [FIM](https://github.com/jmart375/Powershell-Integrity-FIM) (File Integrity Monitor) enhances the security of digital systems by continuously monitoring and validating the integrity of critical files. It promptly detects any unauthorized changes or alterations, providing organizations with real-time alerts and ensuring the integrity and authenticity of essential files. 

## Research Case Study
  - [Case Study](https://github.com/jmart375/Case-Study). This comprehensive project involved multiple deliverables, including System and Security Requirements, Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing, Security Hardening, and adherence to NIST SP800-171R2 regulations.

## System Hardening
System hardening in cybersecurity refers to the process of securing a computer system by reducing its attack surface and minimizing vulnerabilities. The goal is to make the system more resistant to unauthorized access, attacks, and potential exploits. System hardening involves implementing a set of best practices, security configurations, and measures to enhance the overall security posture of the system. 
- Security Technical Implementation Guide [(STIG)](https://github.com/jmart375/STIG) and STIG     Viewer App. The STIG and STIG Viewer App is dedicated to implementing robust security controls through comprehensive STIG configurations. The STIG Viewer App streamlines the review and application of STIG guidelines, facilitating efficient management of security compliance across diverse environments.

- [SCAP](https://github.com/jmart375/SCAP) Compliance Checker utilized to systematically evaluate configurations, assess vulnerabilities, and provide real-time feedback, streamlining the process of maintaining a secure and compliant infrastructure.

## Security Systems Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) - Research Case Study
Developed cryptographically secure approaches to system engineering. The following actions were taken:
1. Create an effective security architecture and corresponding evaluation strategy that addresses 
an organization‚Äôs entire threat space
2. Perform a Risk Assessment from detailed threat and risk analysis on an organization deriving a 
detailed list of security requirements based on statutory and regulatory requirements coupled 
with the aforementioned risk assessment
3. Produce a specification for a system security control implementation 
4. Implement an authentication and authorization server after performing an attack surface 
analysis, then test the implemented security system so as to create an effective systems 
monitoring plan for the installed server 
5. Explain the fundamental considerations in systems disposal planning and execution
