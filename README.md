# üë®‚Äçüíª Projects:

## Cyber Forensics
Digital forensics is the process of recovering data from electronic devices, such as hard       drives and cell phones.
  - [Autopsy](https://github.com/jmart375/Autopsy) Project

## Firewall Tools
Firewalls prevent unauthorized users from accessing the company intranet and can be             implemented as hardware, software or a hybrid of the two..
  - [pfSense](https://github.com/jmart375/pfSense) on Virtual Machine
    
## Network Intrusion Detection
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors network and system traffic for unusual or or       suspicious activity and notifies the administrator if a potential threat is detected. 
  - [Snort IDS](https://github.com/jmart375/Snort-IDS/tree/main)
  - TBD; security onion
    
## Network Security Monitoring Tools
These tools are used to analyze network data and detect network-based threats.
  - [Splunk](https://github.com/jmart375/Threat-Hunting-with-the-Splunk-SIEM) Technology

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to help organizations manage and improve their cybersecurity risk management processes.

## Packet Sniffers
A packet sniffer, also called a packet analyzer, protocol analyzer or network analyzer, is      used to intercept, log, and analyze network traffic and data. These are tools designed to capture and analyze packets transmitted over a network. They operate by intercepting and logging network traffic, allowing users to examine the contents of packets for various purposes.

## Penetration Testing
Also known as "pen test", simulates an attack on a computer system in order to evaluate the 
security of that system.

- [Reconnaissance](https://github.com/jmart375/Reconnaissance/)
  
## PowerShell 
PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework. PowerShell runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

  - [Active Directory](https://github.com/jmart375/Active-directory) Bulk User Creation

## System Hardening
System hardening in cybersecurity refers to the process of securing a computer system by reducing its attack surface and minimizing vulnerabilities. The goal is to make the system more resistant to unauthorized access, attacks, and potential exploits. System hardening involves implementing a set of best practices, security configurations, and measures to enhance the overall security posture of the system.

## Security Systems Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) - Research Case Study
Developed cryptographically secure approaches to system engineering. The following actions were taken:
1. Create an effective security architecture and corresponding evaluation strategy that addresses 
an organization‚Äôs entire threat space
2. Perform a Risk Assessment from detailed threat and risk analysis on an organization deriving a 
detailed list of security requirements based on statutory and regulatory requirements coupled 
with the aforementioned risk assessment
3. Produce a specification for a system security control implementation 
4. Implement an authentication and authorization server after performing an attack surface 
analysis, then test the implemented security system so as to create an effective systems 
monitoring plan for the installed server 
5. Explain the fundamental considerations in systems disposal planning and execution

## Vulnerability Assessment and Scanners
Vulnerability scanners are valuable tools that search for and report on what known              vulnerabilities are present in an organization‚Äôs IT infrastructure.
