## Packet Sniffers
A packet sniffer, also called a packet analyzer, protocol analyzer or network analyzer, is      used to intercept, log, and analyze network traffic and data. These are tools designed to capture and analyze packets transmitted over a network. They operate by intercepting and logging network traffic, allowing users to examine the contents of packets for various purposes.
